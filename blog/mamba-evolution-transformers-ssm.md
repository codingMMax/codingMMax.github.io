- **Multimodal Applications**: How these techniques apply to multimodal AI systems

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**
   - Linear attention variants
   - Sparse attention patterns
   - Low-rank approximations

2. **State Space Models**
   - Structured State Space (S4) models
   - Diagonal State Space (DSS) models
   - Connections to RNNs and CNNs

3. **Mamba and Recent Advances**
   - Selective state spaces
   - Hardware-efficient implementations
   - Performance comparisons

4. **Practical Applications**
   - Long sequence modeling
   - Multimodal fusion
   - Real-world deployment considerations
