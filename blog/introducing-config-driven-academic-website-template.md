# My Config-Driven Academic Website Template

I got tired of manually editing HTML files every time I wanted to update my academic website, so I built a simple system that lets me manage everything through a JSON configuration file.

## The Problem I Had

Like many academics, I struggled with:
- Editing HTML files for every publication update
- Keeping formatting consistent across pages
- Worrying about breaking the layout
- Spending time on code instead of content

## My Solution

I created a system where all my content lives in a single `config.json` file, and GitHub Actions automatically generates the HTML pages.

### Before and After

**Before**: Editing HTML directly
```html
<div class="publication-item">
  <img src="teaser/my-paper.jpg" alt="My Paper">
  <div class="publication-content">
    <p class="publication-title">My Research Paper</p>
    <!-- lots more HTML... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**After**: Simple JSON structure
```json
{
  "title": "My Research Paper",
  "authors": ["Sixun Dong", "Collaborators"],
  "venue": "CVPR 2025",
  "image": "teaser/my-paper.jpg",
  "links": [{"name": "Paper", "url": "https://..."}]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Edit config.json** with your content
2. **Push to GitHub** 
3. **GitHub Actions** runs and generates HTML
4. **Website updates** automatically

The build process uses Node.js scripts that read the JSON and generate HTML using templates.

## Key Features

### Single Configuration File
Everything lives in `config.json`:
- Personal info and bio
- Publications by year
- News updates
- Experience and education

### Automatic HTML Generation
GitHub Actions detects changes to the config and rebuilds the site automatically.

### Blog System
Blog posts are written in Markdown with frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-01-01"
description: "Brief description"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
---

# Your content here...
```

### Publication Management
Publications are organized by year with support for:
- Different venue types (conference, journal, under review)
- Featured publications that appear on homepage
- Multiple links (paper, code, dataset, etc.)
- Automatic author name highlighting

## Technical Implementation

The system consists of:
- **Build scripts** (Node.js) that process the JSON config
- **HTML templates** for different page types
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for automation
- **Simple CSS/JS** for styling and interactions

### Local Development
You can build and preview locally:
```bash
python build_local.py  # Generate HTML
python local_server.py # Start local server
```

## What I Learned

Building this taught me:
- GitHub Actions is quite powerful for automation
- JSON is a good format for structured academic content
- Simple solutions often work better than complex ones
- Documentation matters (I should write more)

## Current Status

The template works well for my needs, but it's still evolving. I add features as I need them:
- âœ… Basic publication management
- âœ… Blog system with Markdown
- âœ… Automated deployment
- âœ… Comment system (Waline)
- âœ… Favicon support
- ðŸ”„ Better mobile experience
- ðŸ”„ More customization options

## Using This Template

If you want to use this for your own site:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Edit** `config.json` with your information
3. **Enable** GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. **Push** changes to trigger the build

The source code is available on GitHub. It's not the most polished system, but it works for my needs and might be useful for others.

## Limitations

This approach has some downsides:
- Requires basic Git/GitHub knowledge
- Limited customization without editing code
- Build process can be slow for large sites
- No real-time preview (need to push to see changes)

## Future Ideas

Things I might add:
- Better theme customization
- More publication types
- Integration with citation managers
- Mobile app for quick updates
- Better documentation

## Conclusion

This system solved my specific problem of maintaining an academic website without dealing with HTML. It's not perfect, but it's much easier than manually editing files.
