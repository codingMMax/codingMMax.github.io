# Introducing Config-Driven Academic Website Template: No More HTML Editing!

As a PhD student, I've always struggled with maintaining my academic website. Every time I wanted to add a new publication, update my bio, or modify my experience section, I had to dive into HTML files, remember the exact formatting, and worry about breaking something. After doing this countless times, I decided to build a better solution.

Today, I'm excited to introduce the **Config-Driven Academic Website Template** ‚Äì a revolutionary system that lets you manage your entire website through a single JSON configuration file, powered by GitHub Actions for automatic deployment.

## üéØ The Problem with Traditional Academic Websites

Most academic websites require you to:
- ‚úã Edit raw HTML files for every update
- ‚úã Remember complex formatting rules
- ‚úã Manually maintain consistency across pages
- ‚úã Risk breaking the layout with a single typo
- ‚úã Spend time on technicalities instead of content

## üöÄ The Solution: Configuration-Driven Content Management

What if updating your website was as simple as editing a text file? That's exactly what this template offers:

### Before (Traditional Way)
```html
<!-- Editing index.html -->
<div class="publication-item">
  <img src="teaser/my-paper.jpg" alt="My Paper" class="publication-image teaser">
  <div class="publication-content">
    <p class="publication-title">
      <span class="publication-venue">CVPR 2025</span> 
      My Amazing Research Paper
    </p>
    <p class="publication-authors">
      John Doe, <span class="author-highlight">My Name</span>, Jane Smith
    </p>
    <!-- ... more complex HTML ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### After (Config-Driven Way)
```json
{
  "title": "My Amazing Research Paper",
  "authors": ["John Doe", "My Name", "Jane Smith"],
  "venue": "CVPR 2025",
  "venue_type": "conference",
  "image": "teaser/my-paper.jpg",
  "links": [
    {"name": "Paper", "url": "https://arxiv.org/...", "icon": "ai ai-arxiv"},
    {"name": "Code", "url": "https://github.com/...", "icon": "fab fa-github"}
  ]
}
```

The difference is night and day! üåü

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîß **Single Configuration File**
All your content lives in one `config.json` file:
- Personal information and bio
- Publications with automatic formatting
- Experience and education
- News updates and social links

### ü§ñ **GitHub Actions Automation**
- Detects changes to your config file
- Automatically generates HTML pages
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Zero manual intervention required

### üé® **Professional Design**
- Clean, modern academic layout
- Responsive design for all devices
- Optimized for readability and accessibility
- Consistent formatting across all pages

### üöÄ **Easy Publication Management**
Adding a new paper is as simple as:
```json
"2025": [
  {
    "title": "Your New Paper Title",
    "featured": true,  // Will appear on homepage
    "authors": ["You", "Collaborators"],
    "venue": "CVPR 2025",
    "venue_type": "conference",
    "is_oral": true,  // Optional oral presentation badge
    "links": [...]
  }
]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The magic happens through a sophisticated GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **You edit** `config.json` with your content
2. **GitHub Actions detects** the change when you push
3. **Automated script** generates new HTML files using templates
4. **Website updates** automatically on GitHub Pages

### The Architecture

```
config.json ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí HTML Generation ‚Üí GitHub Pages
     ‚Üë              ‚Üì               ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Your edits    Auto-trigger    Template engine   Live website
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Template
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/Ironieser/ironieser.github.io.git
cd ironieser.github.io
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Content
Edit `config.json` with your information:
```json
{
  "personal": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "PhD Student in Computer Science",
    "affiliation": "Your University",
    "email": "your.email@university.edu",
    "bio": [
      "Your first bio paragraph...",
      "Your second bio paragraph..."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Push and Deploy
```bash
git add config.json
git commit -m "Update personal information"
git push
```

That's it! Your website will be updated within 1-2 minutes automatically.
