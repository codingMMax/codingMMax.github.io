# Welcome to My Academic Homepage

Welcome to my academic homepage! This site showcases my research work, publications, and thoughts on computer vision and AI.

## What You'll Find Here

### üè† **About Me**
The main page has my current position, research interests, and recent news. I'm a PhD student at Arizona State University working on multimodal AI systems.

### üìö **Publications**
A collection of my research papers organized by year, including:
- Conference and journal papers
- Links to papers, code, and datasets
- Brief descriptions and visual previews

### üìù **Blog**
Occasional posts about:
- Research insights and experiences
- Technical notes and tutorials
- Thoughts on AI and computer vision

## How This Site Works

This website is built using a config-driven approach that I developed:

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration-Based**
- All content is managed through a single `config.json` file
- Publications, news, and personal info are all in structured data
- Makes it easy to update without editing HTML

### ü§ñ **Automated Building**
- GitHub Actions automatically generates HTML from the config
- Blog posts are written in Markdown and processed automatically
- Changes are deployed automatically when I push updates

### üé® **Simple Design**
- Clean, academic layout focused on content
- Responsive design that works on mobile
- Uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Technical Details

For those interested in the implementation:

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, no frameworks
- **Build Process**: Node.js scripts that process JSON config
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- **Blog System**: Markdown files processed into HTML
- **Comments**: Waline comment system for blog posts

The source code is available on GitHub if you want to see how it works or use it for your own site.

## Recent Updates

I regularly update the site with:
- New publications as they get accepted
- Research news and career updates
- Occasional blog posts about my work

## Contact
